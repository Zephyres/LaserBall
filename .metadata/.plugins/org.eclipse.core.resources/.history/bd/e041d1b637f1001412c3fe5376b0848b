You wake up,
in a two-dimensional euclidean manifold.

You are trapped
behind a set of invisible boundaries.
*
You have entered
THE LASERZONE
*
You notice that your human body has been replaced by a triangle,
superimposed onto a lower dimension.

Experimenting with your newfound body,
you discover that you can shoot projectiles.
*
Suddenly, your dim surroundings brighten up,
illuminated by an unseen light source.

Enemies start appearing out of nowhere.
*
Trapped in this strange dimension,
All you can do is survive.
